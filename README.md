# weather-app
R & D exercise using vanilla Javascript to make a basic app getting the weather from https://openweathermap.org/.
To avoid including the api key I have used dummy data on this version recorded on 8/2/21. The available location searches are London, Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff and Dublin.
